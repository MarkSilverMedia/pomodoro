# Pomodoro Productivity Scripts
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where a timer is used to designate a specific amount of time to work on any given task, followed by a break of a shorter interval. This repository contains my scripts for a sort of modified version of the method. You see, the Internet is probably my biggest distractor, so I have to be productive for 55 minutes in order to earn 5 minutes of Internet free time on my personal laptop (though i can use the internet on the school-issued chromebook provided it relates to a task at hand). This Internet time acts as a defacto currency that I can save up over time, & spend using one of the scripts in this collection (which is basically my network manager lol). Productive tasks include music production, score writing, scholarship essays/applications, & homework. If this is at all interesting to you, feel free to fork the scripts here for your own purposes.
